This is my version of Rock, Paper, Scissors. It will be played against the computer. In order to win, you must be the first to accrue 3 wins. You lose if you aren't the first the 3 wins. The game will keep playing as long as no player has 3 wins. Ties do not count towards wins or losses but the ties tally will be listed. The rounds will be each turn. For example, the game will display something like, 'Round 1: you win/lose/tie.'
Stretch Goals: Reset button. CSS styling. Responsive mobile design (flexbox). Working with instructors to determine additional stretch goals.

6/26/23 created new repo and met with instructor to determine my project and wrote up a README.

US1: Upon loading the website, the user should be greeted with a splash screen. The screen should have a welcome message and when the user clicks anywhere on the screen, the splash screen should disappear revealing the game.
  -We need to have a div with a named class/id that we can manipulate with CSS/JS.
  -We will use the DOM to add an event listener 'click' so when users click on the page, the splash screen goes away.
  -We will use CSS to style the splash screen.

US2: After the splash screen has disappeared, we need to see the buttons for rock, paper, scissors. 
  -buttons need to be labeled 
  -what happens when we press a button? Buttons need to have functionality
