This is my version of Rock, Paper, Scissors. It will be played against the computer. In order to win, you must be the first to accrue 3 wins. You lose if you aren't the first the 3 wins. The game will keep playing as long as no player has 3 wins. Ties do not count towards wins or losses but the ties tally will be listed. The rounds will be each turn. For example, the game will display something like, 'Round 1: you win/lose/tie.'
